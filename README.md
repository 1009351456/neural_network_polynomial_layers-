#Description
PolyNN is a neural network library, made from scratch. Unlike classical neural networks, they are able to learn polynomial functions.

#Credits
Thanks to Michael Nielsen whose [book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) gave me great insight about the fundamentals of machine learning.
