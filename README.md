# Description

PolyNN is a neural network library, made from scratch. Unlike classical neural networks, they are able to learn polynomial functions.

# Known limitations

Sometimes, the learning process diverges violently. Making the learning process more stable is a work in progress. **fixed**

Sofar, only simple (defined componentwise and equal on each component) threshold functions are usable by PolyNN. This is a work in progress.

# Credits
Thanks to Michael Nielsen whose [book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) gave me great insight about the fundamentals of machine learning.
