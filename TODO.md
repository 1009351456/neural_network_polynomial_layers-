# TODO
- [x] Make learning process more stable.
- [x] Implement method BatchLearning for class PolyNN
- [ ] Make ap.differential effective : implementing a method Polynomial.evaluate_partial_derivative could be a solution
- [ ] Make PolyNN compatible with any threshold function
- [ ] Integrate into Tensorflow
